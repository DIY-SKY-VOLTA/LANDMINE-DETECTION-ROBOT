// Our ESP32CAM board is having inbuilt TTL converter, so we quickly completed our task.
//Some ESP32CAM modules are avaiable without inbuilt TTL module,soo you have to buy seperate TTL module or MB programmer board to programme ESP32CAM. 

ISSUES:
Some issues will occur while uploading the code is due to improper supply (5v required), camera wrover module heats up quicky to be controlled using a small 5v CPU exaust fan.
Sometimes the CAM don't show IP ADDRESS for that you have to try multiple time and be carefull while pressing the reset button should maiantain correct timing.
Should compulsarly maintain the BAUD rate 11520.
The ESP32CAM to be connected with local WIFI, so you have to add the SSID, PASSWORD of your local WIFI.
Check your internet connection and speed often mportant for soft video output.
